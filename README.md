# Mood-sync
### 02808 Personal Data Interaction for Mobile and Wearables - Group 1
## Abstract
The objective of this project is to introduce a mood tracking app that correlates user mood with screen time. The app allows daily mood input and provides visualizations that allow the user to understand if there is a correlation between a specific mood and the level of phone usage, facilitating informed decision-making. Development focused on core functionalities such as mood input and visualization, with usability tests conducted to assess user interest and validate design choices. Results indicated a predominantly female user base and highlighted the necessity of a daily mood input reminder. Additionally, user feedback guided the selection of visualizations for clarity and user-friendliness
